    A paragraph is a series of sentences that are <b>organized and coherent</b>, and are all related to a single topic.
    Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
     This is because <del>paragraphs</del> <ins>paragraphssssss</ins>  show a reader where the <b>subdivisions</b> of an essay begin and end, 
     and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.
