    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent,<p> and are all related to a single topic. </p>Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
