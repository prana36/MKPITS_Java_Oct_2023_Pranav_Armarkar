let a = 2;   // Binary representation 10 
let b = 4;   // Binary representation 100 
  
console.log(a ^= b);
//The number 2 is represented as 10 in binary, and the number 3 is represented as 100 in binary. When the XOR assignment is performed 110  is returned which after conversion to decimal returns 6.
