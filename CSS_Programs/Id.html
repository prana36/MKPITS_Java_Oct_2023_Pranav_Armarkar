      A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and
      are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do
      that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
      <br />
      This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an
      essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the
      essay and grasp its main points. <br />
      Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph
      could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of
      a general point. <br />
      It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of
      events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into
      categories; or describe causes and effects. <br />
      Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share
      certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic
      sentence.
