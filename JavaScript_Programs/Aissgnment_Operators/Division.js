// JavaScript Division Assignment Operator in JavaScript is represented by “/=”.
// This operator is used to divide the value of the variable by the value of the right operand and that result is going to be assigned to the variable. 
// This can also be explained as dividing the value of the variable by an expression and assigning that result to the variable.

// Syntax:

// a /= b
// or
// a = a / b
let x = 18;
x /= 3;
console.log(x);

x /= 2;
console.log(x);

x /= 0;
console.log(x);



let a = 18;
a /= 3;
console.log(a);

a /= "bar";
console.log(a);
