    <!-- 
     These lines create a group of radio buttons allowing users to select their gender. 
      Each radio button is enclosed within a <label> element, providing a clickable label text. 
	    Both radio buttons share the same name attribute, enabling selection of only one option at a time. 
	    This setup ensures that selecting one option automatically deselects the other, 
	    offering users a mutually exclusive choice between "Male" and "Female" genders -->

    <label>Male:<input type="radio" name="status" /></label>
    <label>Female:<input type="radio" name="status" /></label>
