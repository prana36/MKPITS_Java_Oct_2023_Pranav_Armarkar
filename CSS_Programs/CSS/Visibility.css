/* This property is used to specify whether or not an element is visible. 
We can set this property to visible (default), hidden or collapse.

hidden - The element is invisible not removed.
collapse – This value is only used for table elements. 
collapse removes a row or column, but it does not affect the table layout. 
The space taken up by the row or column will be available for other content. 
If collapse is used on other elements, it will be treated as “hidden”.
Ex:- 
p { visibility: hidden;} */

p {
  visibility: hidden;
}
