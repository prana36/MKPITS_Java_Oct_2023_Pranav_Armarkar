      A new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt with
      loans from the Bavarian state government and Marshall Plan aid.[22] The
      reformed company was launched 3 September 1949 and continued DKW's
      tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke
      engines.[22] This included production of a small but sturdy 125 cc
      motorcycle and a DKW delivery van, the DKW F89 L at Ingolstadt. The
      Ingolstadt site was large, consisting of an extensive complex of formerly
      military buildings which was suitable for administration as well as
      vehicle warehousing and distribution, but at this stage there was at
      Ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles:
      for manufacturing the company's first post-war mass-market passenger car
      plant capacity in Düsseldorf was rented from Rheinmetall-Borsig. It was
      only ten years later, after the company had attracted an investor, when
      funds became available for construction of major car plant at the
      Ingolstadt head office site. In 1958, in response to pressure from
      Friedrich Flick, then the company's largest single shareholder,[23]
      Daimler-Benz took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was
      increased to a 100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were
      not the focus of Daimler-Benz's interests, and while the early 1960s saw
      major investment in new Mercedes models and in a state of the art factory
      for Auto Union's, the company's aging model range at this time did not
      benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent as
      competitor manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Opel. The decision to
      dispose of the Auto Union business was based on its lack of
      profitability.[24] Ironically, by the time they sold the business, it also
      included a large new factory and near production-ready modern four-stroke
      engine, which would enable the Auto Union business, under a new owner, to
      embark on a period of profitable growth, now producing not Auto Unions or
      DKWs, but using the "Audi" name, resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap.
      In 1964, Volkswagen acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included
      the new factory in Ingolstadt, the DKW and Audi brands along with the
      rights to the new engine design which had been funded by Daimler-Benz, who
      in return retained the dormant Horch trademark and the Düsseldorf factory
      which became a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant. Eighteen months later,
      Volkswagen bought complete control of Ingolstadt, and by 1966 were using
      the spare capacity of the Ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional
      60,000 Volkswagen Beetles per year.[25] Two-stroke engines became less
      popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother
      four-stroke engines. In September 1965, the DKW F102 was fitted with a
      four-stroke engine and a facelift for the car's front and rear. Volkswagen
      dumped the DKW brand because of its associations with two-stroke
      technology, and having classified the model internally as the F103, sold
      it simply as the "Audi". Later developments of the model were named after
      their horsepower ratings and sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90,
      selling until 1972. Initially, Volkswagen was hostile to the idea of Auto
      Union as a standalone entity producing its own models having acquired the
      company merely to boost its own production capacity through the Ingolstadt
      assembly plant – to the point where Volkswagen executives ordered that the
      Auto Union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the
      factory buildings. Then VW chief Heinz Nordhoff explicitly forbade Auto
      Union from any further product development. Fearing that Volkswagen had no
      long-term ambition for the Audi brand, Auto Union engineers under the
      leadership of Ludwig Kraus developed the first Audi 100 in secret, without
      Nordhoff's knowledge. When presented with a finished prototype, Nordhoff
      was so impressed he authorised the car for production, which when launched
      in 1968, went on to be a huge success. With this, the resurrection of the
      Audi brand was now complete, this being followed by the first generation
      Audi 80 in 1972, which would in turn provide a template for VW's new
      front-wheel-drive water-cooled range which debuted from the mid-1970s
      onward.
