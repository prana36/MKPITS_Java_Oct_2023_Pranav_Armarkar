      A paragraph is a series of sentences that are
      <b>organized and coherent</b>, and are all related to a single topic.
      Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences
      should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a
      reader where the <b>subdivisions</b> of an essay begin and end, and thus
      help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main
      points.
