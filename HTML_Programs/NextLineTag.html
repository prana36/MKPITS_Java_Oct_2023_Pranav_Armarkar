    A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.<br>Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. 
        <br>This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, <br>and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.
