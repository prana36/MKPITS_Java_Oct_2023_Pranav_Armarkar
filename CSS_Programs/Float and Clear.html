    <h2>In the United States</h2>

    <p>
      In the United States As Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit
      racing, they chose to move first into America with the Trans-Am in 1988.
      In 1989, Audi moved to International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) GTO
      with the Audi 90, however as they avoided the two major endurance events
      (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose
      out on the title. Touring cars In 1990, having completed their objective
      to market cars in North America, Audi returned to Europe, turning first to
      the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) series with the Audi V8, and
      then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they
      turned their attention to the fast-growing Super Touring series, which are
      a series of national championships. Audi first entered in the French
      Supertourisme and Italian Superturismo. In the following year, Audi would
      switch to the German Super Tourenwagen Cup (known as STW), and then to
      British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) the year after that. The
      Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), having difficulty
      regulating the quattro four-wheel drive system, and the impact it had on
      the competitors, would eventually ban all four-wheel drive cars from
      competing in the series in 1998,[94] but by then, Audi switched all their
      works efforts to sports car racing. By 2000, Audi would still compete in
      the US with their RS4 for the SCCA Speed World GT Challenge, through
      dealer/team Champion Racing competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and
      smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars). In
      2003, Champion Racing entered an RS6. Once again, the quattro four-wheel
      drive was superior, and Champion Audi won the championship. They returned
      in 2004 to defend their title, but a newcomer, Cadillac with the new Omega
      Chassis CTS-V, gave them a run for their money. After four victories in a
      row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply
      affected the car's performance. Namely, added ballast weights, and
      Champion Audi deciding to go with different tyres, and reducing the boost
      pressure of the turbocharger. In 2004, after years of competing with the
      TT-R in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team Abt
      Racing/Christian Abt taking the 2002 title with Laurent Aïello, Audi
      returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two
      factory-supported Joest Racing A4 DTM cars. 24 Hours of Le Mans Further
      information: List of Audi vehicles § Le Mans prototypes Audi R10 TDI Audi
      began racing prototype sportscars in 1999, debuting at the Le Mans 24
      hour. Two car concepts were developed and raced in their first season -
      the Audi R8R (open-cockpit 'roadster' prototype) and the Audi R8C
      (closed-cockpit 'coupé' GT-prototype). The R8R scored a credible podium on
      its racing debut at Le Mans and was the concept which Audi continued to
      develop into the 2000 season due to favourable rules for open-cockpit
      prototypes. However, most of the competitors (such as BMW, Toyota,
      Mercedes and Nissan) retired at the end of 1999. The factory-supported
      Joest Racing team won at Le Mans three times in a row with the Audi R8
      (2000–2002), as well as winning every race in the American Le Mans Series
      in its first year. Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as
      Champion Racing. In 2003, two Bentley Speed 8s, with engines designed by
      Audi, and driven by Joest drivers loaned to the fellow Volkswagen Group
      company, competed in the GTP class, and finished the race in the top two
      positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall, and first
      in the LMP900 class. Audi returned to the winner's podium at the 2004
      race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team
      Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing
      third. At the 2005 24 Hours of Le Mans, Champion Racing entered two R8s,
      along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team Oreca. The R8s (which were
      built to old LMP900 regulations) received a narrower air inlet restrictor,
      reducing power, and an additional 50 kg (110 lb) of weight compared to the
      newer LMP1 chassis. On average, the R8s were about 2–3 seconds off pace
      compared to the Pescarolo–Judd. But with a team of excellent drivers and
      experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third, while the
      Oreca team took fourth. The Champion team was also the first American team
      to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GTs in 1967. This also ends the long
      era of the R8; however, its replacement for 2006, called the Audi R10 TDI,
      was unveiled on 13 December 2005. The R10 TDI employed many new and
      innovative features, the most notable being the twin-turbocharged direct
      injection diesel engine. It was first raced in the 2006 12 Hours of
      Sebring as a race-test in preparation for the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans,
      which it later went on to win. Audi had a win in the first diesel sports
      car at 12 Hours of Sebring (the car was developed with a Diesel engine due
      to ACO regulations that favor diesel engines). As well as winning the 24
      Hours of Le Mans in 2006, the R10 TDI beat the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP in
      2007, and in 2008, (however Peugeot won the 24h in 2009) with a podium
      clean-sweep (all four 908 entries retired) while breaking a distance
      record (set by the Porsche 917K of Martini Racing in 1971), in 2010 with
      the R15 TDI Plus.[95] Audi's sports car racing success would continue with
      the Audi R18's victory at the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans. Audi Sport Team
      Joest's Benoît Tréluyer earned Audi their first pole position in five
      years while the team's sister car locked out the front row.[96] Early
      accidents eliminated two of Audi's three entries, but the sole remaining
      Audi R18 TDI of Tréluyer, Marcel Fässler, and André Lotterer held off the
      trio of Peugeot 908s to claim victory by a margin of 13.8 seconds.
